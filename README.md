Project Description :
The Kanban Board is a task management web application built using React, Tailwind CSS, @hello-pangea/dnd for drag-and-drop functionality, and JSON Server as a mock backend API. It is designed to help users visually organize tasks into three statuses — To Do, In Progress, and Done — much like a traditional kanban system.

Users can:

- Add new tasks with a title and description

- Drag tasks between columns to change their status

- Persist these changes by updating the backend using axios
